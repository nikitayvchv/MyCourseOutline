# My Course Outline
This is a repository to help with marking the work that I have done over the entire course. I'll put links and all of the code in this repo so that it's all in one place. There will also be notes and stuff to help out.

## 10 Strands I have done:
1. JavaScript
* JavaScript will be found on Khan Academy. All of the projects and challenges have been 100% completed and the projects themselves will be in this repo in their own folder. 
---------------------
2. HTML/CSS
* HTML/CSS is 100% completed as well --> the projects themselves will be in this repo.
---------------------
3. Algorithms
* Algorithms is 100% complete, however one of the projects (Recursive Art) is bugged and not able to submit, so it only shows as 98% complete. They will be here in this repo.
---------------------
4. Nature of Code
* Nature of Code from Khan Academy is 100% complete and in this repository. This was probably my favourite Khan Academy course.
---------------------
5. GitHub Profile
* My GitHub Profile can be found [here](https://nikitayvchv.github.io/SpiralCode/Profile/). I have not yet found a way to make the projects I have be on the same repo so i'll have to figure that out.
---------------------
6. 20Time
* My 20Time project has it's own repo on my profile found [here](https://github.com/nikitayvchv/20TimeProject). The presentation has been directly shared with you on Google Slides (you probably recieved an email as well).
---------------------
7. Twitter Bots
* The Twitter Bot repo can be found [here](https://github.com/AYJACKSON-ICS4U/twitter-bots-nikita-sarah-jason-and-jordan). It was a colaberation with Sarah, Jason, and Jordon. The twitter bot is fully functioning, and will send out a tweet that says "HELLO THIS IS ME". It can also be programmed to take one of Sarah's Bot's code if the lines are uncommented.
---------------------
8. Shared Canvas
* The shared canvas is fully working and will share a Nature of code project on a local host (the vector walker). The repo is [here](https://github.com/sarahchoww/shared-drawing-canvas-websockets-and-p5-js-sarah-jordan).
---------------------
9. Coding Challenge
* Our coding challenge is going to be presented in class. We did the Fireworks challenge by Daniel Shiffman. Our repo is [here](https://github.com/JNGUY5/FireworksCodingChalleng), so that we all have a copy of the code and what we individually did. My role was to figure out the "challenge" part, and how to make different shapes with the fireworks. I made hearts.
---------------------
10. Workflow
* Workflow will be done on the Exam date. I will update this part of the repo when it's completed.

Thank you for a wonderful course, Mr. O!
